# Rental Recommendation Agent: Personalized Apartment Search

**New here?** Start with [SETUP.md](SETUP.md) for install + run + test instructions.

A conversational apartment-hunting agent built as part of INFO 290: Generative AI at UC Berkeley. The idea came from a pretty universal pain point - searching for a rental is tedious, results are scattered across a dozen sites, and standard search filters don't capture the nuance of what people actually care about (commute time, noise level, whether there's a good gym nearby, etc.).

This project explores what a better version of that experience could look like when you combine a conversational LLM with real-time web search, parallel multi-agent research, and structured preference reasoning.

## What It Does

The system talks with you first. Rather than making you fill out a form, it asks a few targeted questions to understand your priorities - budget, location, commute destinations, lifestyle preferences, and importantly, how you'd trade those off against each other. Once it has enough to go on, it finds candidate listings, then spins up a research agent per listing that decides what tools to call based on your specific situation. Someone with a dog gets pet policy checked immediately. Someone who cares about a bar scene gets a places lookup for that. Someone who didn't mention grocery stores doesn't waste an API call on it.

The result is a ranked recommendation list built from real data - actual commute times, actual nearby places, actual listing details - not inferred from search snippets. After ranking, an analyzer node reviews both the recommended and disqualified listings to surface cross-cutting market patterns: whether your budget is realistic for the area, what's actually eliminating options, and concrete suggestions for adjusting the search.

## How the Listing Agents Work

Each listing agent is a ReAct (Reason + Act) agent. It has a set of tools and decides which ones to call based on what it finds and what the user cares about - not a fixed pipeline.

Example for a user with a dog who wants bars nearby:

```
scrape_listing(url)
  finds: price, floor, description, no pet policy listed

user has a dog - need to verify pet policy before going further
  search_web("pet policy 4521 Telegraph Ave Oakland")
  result: "pets allowed with $500 deposit"

commute check - user listed UC Berkeley as a destination
  get_commute_time("4521 Telegraph Ave", "UC Berkeley", mode="transit")
  result: "14 min BART"

user mentioned bars in soft_constraints
  find_nearby_places("4521 Telegraph Ave", "bars")
  result: "Temescal strip 0.1mi"

user didn't mention grocery stores - skip that lookup
done, returning profile
```

A different user with different preferences triggers a completely different set of tool calls.

---

## Tools

The listing agents have access to five tools. Which ones get called depends on the user's preferences — not every agent uses every tool.

| Tool | API | Status |
|---|---|---|
| `scrape_listing` | Firecrawl | Implemented |
| `search_web` | SerpAPI (Google) | Implemented |
| `analyze_listing_photos` | Claude Sonnet 4.6 (vision) | Implemented |
| `get_commute_time` | Google Maps Distance Matrix API | Implemented |
| `find_nearby_places` | Google Places API (New) + Geocoding | Implemented |

---

## Example Listing Profile

Each ReAct listing agent returns a structured JSON profile with fields selected based on the user's preferences. Example for a user with a dog who cares about commute and wants bars nearby:

```json
{
  "url": "https://sfbay.craigslist.org/eby/apa/d/oakland-temescal-2br",
  "disqualified": false,
  "disqualify_reason": null,
  "price": 2350,
  "floor": 1,
  "address": "4521 Telegraph Ave, Temescal, Oakland, CA",
  "views": false,
  "pet_friendly": true,
  "pet_deposit": 400,
  "furnishing": "unfurnished",
  "images": [
    "https://images.craigslist.org/00A0A_ex1_600x450.jpg",
    "https://images.craigslist.org/00D0D_ex2_600x450.jpg"
  ],
  "commute_times": {
    "UC Berkeley, Soda Hall": "13 min BART",
    "Downtown Oakland": "10 min BART"
  },
  "nearby_places": {
    "bars": "Temescal strip 0.1mi",
    "coffee shop": "Bicycle Coffee 0.1mi"
  },
  "modern_finishes": false,
  "natural_light": true,
  "spacious": true,
  "condition": "good",
  "notes": "Classic bungalow with a small yard, walkable to Temescal restaurants",
  "description": "2BR Temescal bungalow, yard, pet-friendly"
}
```

Note how only preference-relevant fields are populated. A user who didn't mention bars or commute would receive a profile without `commute_times` or the "bars" `nearby_places` entry — the agent skips unnecessary API calls.

## Evaluation

The evaluation suite lives in [`evals/`](evals/) and covers six component-level experiments plus one end-to-end pipeline experiment:

| Experiment | Scope |
|---|---|
| `elicitation` | Preference extraction accuracy + question quality |
| `planner`     | Search query format, diversity, retry novelty |
| `search`      | SerpAPI result precision, yield, relevance |
| `listing_agent` | Field extraction F1, disqualification accuracy, tool efficiency |
| `image`       | Photo analysis accuracy vs. human labels, consistency |
| `reducer`     | Ranking accuracy, trade-off application, ROUGE-L vs reference |
| `end_to_end`  | Full-pipeline Kendall tau vs human gold rankings on a static 30-listing corpus |

**Reproducibility:** the end-to-end experiment runs against [`evals/datasets/static_listings.json`](evals/datasets/static_listings.json) (30 fixed apartment profiles across SF/Oakland/Chicago) with [`evals/datasets/preference_rankings.json`](evals/datasets/preference_rankings.json) providing human-labeled gold orderings. This pins every external API response so results are comparable across runs.

**Dataset split:** [`evals/datasets/preferences.json`](evals/datasets/preferences.json) explicitly marks each row `"split": "validation"` (rows 1–5, for prompt tuning) or `"split": "test"` (rows 6–10, for final reporting).

**LLM-as-judge:** all judges run on `claude-sonnet-4-6`. Rubrics live in [`evals/metrics/llm_judge.py`](evals/metrics/llm_judge.py).

Run with `python -m evals.run_evals`. See [`evals/README.md`](evals/README.md) for full documentation.

## TODO

- ~~Intent Router node~~ — **done.** Haiku classifier in [`graph/nodes/intent_router.py`](graph/nodes/intent_router.py) routes every message to one of: `needs_search` (→ elicitation), `conversational` (answer from context), `tool_call` (direct commute/places lookup), or `off_topic` (polite decline).
- ~~`find_nearby_places` tool~~ — **done.** Geocodes + Places Nearby Search (new API), maps natural-language types, returns structured results with distances.
- ~~`get_commute_time` tool~~ — **done.** Distance Matrix across transit/driving/bicycling/walking.
- ~~LangSmith observability~~ — **done.** Per-node run names tagged; enable via `LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2=true` in `.env`.
- ~~Evals datasets~~ — **done.** 30-listing static corpus, 10 preferences (5 validation / 5 test), 5 human-ranked preference-to-listing sets, end-to-end experiment registered.
- ~~Data persistence~~ — **done.** `AsyncSqliteSaver` checkpointer wired into `build_graph()` with `thread_id` per session. Session ID persisted in `localStorage`; full conversation history replayed on reconnect from SQLite.
- Photo analysis token cost — `analyze_listing_photos` currently passes all available images to Claude vision. This gives the best analysis quality (no relevant photos get cut) but cost scales linearly with listing photo count — Zillow/Apartments.com listings commonly have 30–50 images. A few options worth considering:
  - **Hard cap with relevance ranking**: do a cheap first-pass call to categorize/label all images, then pass only the top-N most relevant to `focus_areas` for the full analysis. Better quality than a naive slice, but adds a round-trip.
  - **Single-pass expanded**: pass all images in one call but prompt the model to weight its analysis toward images most relevant to `focus_areas`. One call, higher token cost, no extra latency.
  - **Naive cap (original)**: `image_urls[:N]` — cheapest but misses relevant photos that appear later in the listing's sequence.
  Current choice favors analysis quality; revisit if per-listing API cost becomes a concern.
- Scale static corpus to 50–100 — framework supports it; current 30 is the MVP.
